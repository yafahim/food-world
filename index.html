            <p>The other thing that I want to say, before I begin, is that this post is about the micro-level of
                blogging: individual posts. What probably matters more is the macro-level: what’s the idea of your blog?
                The concept? The name? The hook? If you haven’t figured that stuff out, writing great posts may not be
                as effective. For more advice on that front, see the posts on my “How To” food blogging page.

                And now, without further ado…</p>

                <p>Just letting you know that your fruit free clusters is my favourite gluten free cereal!!!! I enjoy a
                    bowl with some organic almond milk and chopped banana. (I know, I add fruit to fruit free cereal). I
                    truly look forward to eating it every morning.</p>

                <h1>Hot Mocha Pudding with Coffee Sauce</h1>
                <p> Just want to let you know what a great product you have developed. I used to make up my own muesli,
                    as most commercial products are heavily sugar & salt laden….awful.
                    I use the Liver cleaning muesli with yoghurt & berries & it keeps me going for hours. I have it
                    every day but usually add a spoonful of organic oats to bulk it up & make it go further.</p>
